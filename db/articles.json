To use MongoDB, you simply use different file in models directory, I.e., models/articles-mongo.js instead of \"models/article.js\"\n\nIn default, it uses a single file named \"db/articles.json\" for its data storage. It's not a data base but a file which is a good fit for a single user and  especially blog data.\n\nThe main point of LEAN stack is to provide easy and light angular, express, and node development to starters.\n\n\nPrinciple\n---------\n\n  * Server-side / Client-side Seperation;\n\n      * Browser does not ask redirection to the server with posting data;\n          * create, update, delete requests are only posted using AJAX call.\n          * when received response, browser decide what to do; forward or error it.\n      * Server does not set client side properties; i.e. cookies, headers\n          * client make request to server using API\n          * when received response, browser decide to set it or not\n\n  * Search-Engine Friendliness\n      * Server-side AngularJS templating\n      * Server-side Layout support\n\nServer-side\n-----------\n\n  * Express\n  * Node\n  * JWT, JSON Web Token, for auth. check\n  * Ruby-On-Rails like application dispatch with controller and action\n  * MVC pattern\n  * Server-side AngularJS templating; `ng-if`, `ng-include`, and `ng-repeat`\n  * Layout support\n\nClient-side\n-----------\n\n  * Search engine friendliness avoiding SPA, single page app\n  * It does not use ngRoute nor uiRoute\n  * Role-based client-side auth. \n  * Custom directives, [`ngd`](https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-directives)\n\nSetup\n---------------\n\n1.
