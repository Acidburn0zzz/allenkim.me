Human vs. Nature
================

When there was no human, Nature thrived.
When human thrived, nature suffered. 
<!--more-->

Convincing nature is not dumb, 
the more attack happens to nature by human,
the more attempt will be to hurt human from nature.

So far, we are still thinking nature is dumb, 
which have maintained its perfection for millions of years.
